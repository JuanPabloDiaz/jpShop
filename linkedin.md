Excited to share my latest project - an E-commerce site built using #React.js, #Vite.js, and #TailwindCSS.

Shopi is a fully responsive online store, leveraging the power of React.js, the most in-demand tool for frontend developers. It integrates Vite.js for a fast and lean development environment, TailwindCSS for efficient style management, and React Router DOM for routes and navigation.

Shopi consumes the Platzi Fake Store API to fetch products. Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to check out the repo for more details. #webdevelopment #frontenddevelopment #coding
