# Jp·Shop: A React-powered online store for a seamless shopping experience

Jp·Shop is a fully responsive online store that leverages the power of React, Vite.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Router DOM to deliver a seamless shopping experience. It's a modern, sleek, and efficient web application that allows users to view products, filter by category, and purchase orders with ease.

It has a login page feature that allows users to sign in and access their account. This feature mimics the workflow and functionality of a real login page, but it does not actually authenticate users.

It also has a shopping cart feature that allows users to add products to their cart and proceed to checkout. The application is fully integrated with the Dummy API, ensuring that users get the latest and greatest products.

Jp·Shop is not just an interface; it's an experience. ️It's simple, stylish, and fast, making online shopping a breeze.
